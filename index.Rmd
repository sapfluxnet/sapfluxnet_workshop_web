<h2>WORKSHOP QUESTIONS</h2>

<b>(Q1)</b> How can we use sap flow and other data streams to quantify transpiration regulation in response to drought at multiple timescales, including the response to repeated seasonal droughts (i.e., tree water use resilience)?  

<b>(Q2)</b> To what extent are key models and remote sensing products capable of reproducing the hydrometeorological controls on transpiration and the physiological resilience patterns observed globally, including the impact and recovery from drought events? 

<b>(Q3)</b> Can whole plant hydraulic conductance, estimated from sap flow and water potential time series, bridge the gap between empirical transpiration responses to drought and modelling results? 

<p>&emsp;<b>Q3a</b> How are in situ estimates of plant hydraulic conductance related to large-scale estimates obtained from model inversion?</p>
