### 11-15 November 2021
at Can Balasc ([CREAF](http://www.creaf.cat/))

### Objectives
The main objective of the workshop is to improve our understanding of tree water use resilience in order to improve drought responses in TBMs, addressing the following questions:

How can we use sap flow time series to quantify transpiration regulation in response to drought at multiple timescales, including the response to repeated seasonal droughts (i.e., tree water use resilience)?

To what extent are key models and remote sensing products capable of reproducing the hydrometeorological controls on transpiration and the physiological resilience patterns observed globally, including the impact and recovery from drought events?

Can whole plant hydraulic conductance, estimated from sap flow and water potential time series, bridge the gap between empirical transpiration responses to drought and modelling results?
